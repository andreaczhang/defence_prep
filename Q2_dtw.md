# ---- DTW ----

- sequence length variability, how big exactly is the variance 
- on what condition would DTW constraints break





## Similarity measures and covariance/correlation

apart from dtw, what are the standard ways to measure similarity? what are the differences? 

- cosine 
  - can be negative.. 
- euclidean 
  - a real distance, always positive 







# ---- Classification ----

## classifiers 



## metrics of performance 





# ---- Multivariate ----

## Factor analysis and PCA



## Matrix decomposition



## Tensor decomposition

isn't parafac2 more similar to high-d svd? I dont see the relation with 1-d tensors 





how to decide the size of latent feature cube (Sk)? cross validation? (also in svd)
